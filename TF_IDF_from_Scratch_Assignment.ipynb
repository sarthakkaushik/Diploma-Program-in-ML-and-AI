        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will implement TF-IDF vectorization of text from scratch using only Python and inbuilt data structures. You will then verify the correctness of the your implementation using a \"grader\" function/cell (provided by us) which will match your implmentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The grader fucntion would help you validate the correctness of your code. \n",

        "**(FAQ) Why bother about implementing a function to compute TF-IDF when it is already available in major libraries?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.\n",
        "1. It helps you improve your coding proficiency.\n",
        "2. It helps you obtain a deeper understanding of the concepts and how it works internally. Knowledge of the internals will also help you debug problems better.\n",
        "3. A lot of product based startups and companies do focus on this in thier interviews to gauge your depth and clarity of understanding along with your programming skills. Hence, most top universities have implementations of some ML algorithms/concepts as mandatory assignments.\n",

        "**NOTE: DO NOT change the \"grader\" functions or code snippets written by us.Please add your code in the suggested locations.**\n",

        "Ethics Code:\n",
        "1. You are welcome to read up online resources to implement the code. \n",
        "2. You can also discuss with your classmates on the implmentation over Slack.\n",
        "3. But, the code you wirte and submit should be yours ONLY. Your code will be compared against other stduents' code and online code snippets to check for plagiarism. If your code is found to be plagiarised, you will be awarded zero-marks for all assignments, which have a 10% wieghtage in the final marks for this course."
